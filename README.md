# IoThing

This is a template for creating projects based around the ESP8266 modules (the ESP-01 and ESP-12 modules in particular are targeted). The template provides the following:

* Schematics and board layouts for simple breakout boards. These are not intended to be an enforced standard, simply a basis for custom projects and a quick way to prototype projects.
* A mechanism for configuring the WiFi settings on a ESP module without needing a physical connection.
* A mechanism for configuring basic operating parameters (eg: MQTT server and topic).
* Support for service discovery so IoThing compatible devices can be found on the local network.

All of the ESP8266 code is based on the Arduino core for the ESP8266.
